# nxostools
Just a small project to show how you might use NXAPI to do some tasks.

Currently utilizing nxapilib to do formatting and such before items are posted.  Need to expand this to allow for general "show" type commands with dictionary or plain ascii return.

Currently no or very minimal error checking is done.  Apps and Wizards may require fairly blank config to execute properly until that is corrected.
